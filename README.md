# Vigenere Visualization Tool
#### Authors: Joshua Fawcett, Max Hopkins, Meghan Riehl, Yuyao Zhuge

1. This system is designed to allow teachers/professors to pedagogically
visualize the steps and results of encrypting and decrypting using the
Vigenere cipher. Some strategies that we used to increase the effectiveness of 
this system as a teaching tool:  
    - Controlling the pace at which the visualization runs
    - Being able to start, stop, and step through the visualization
    - Allowing users to provide input to the algorithm
    - Rewind capabilities
    - Hypertext explanations of the display in the form of colored rectangles
      over the letters of interest
  
2. The implementation for this system started on and 5/18/21 finished on 5/30/21.

3. This system was created as the final submission for Project 2 in CIS 422, Spring 2021, with Professor Anthony Hornof.

4. To run the system, simply navigate to the `executable` folder and run `VigenereVisualization.exe`. This 
will start the program.
   
5. This project was programmed in Python 3.9.5 using pygame 2.0.1

6. The directory structure:
   - The `executable` directory houses the executable that will run this system
   - The `Main_Program` directory houses all of the files that were compiled into the executable.
   - The `Development_Files` directory houses all files that were used to help develop the system.
   These files are not necessary for the system to run, but were implemented into the system in some 
     way. These file may not be up to date, as they were not updated after being integrated.
