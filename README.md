# Vigenere Visualization Tool
Authors: Joshua Fawcett, Max Hopkins, Meghan Riehl, Yuyao Zhuge

1.This system is designed to allow teachers/professors to pedagogically
visualize the steps and results of encrypting and decrypting using the
Vigenere cipher. Some strategies that we used to increase the effectiveness of 
this system as a teaching tool:  
    - `Controlling the pace at which the visualization runs`  
    - `Being able to start, stop, and step through the visualization`  
    - `Allowing users to provide input to the algorithm`  
    - `Rewind capabilites`  
    - `Hypertext explanations of the display in the form of colored rectangles
      over the letters of interest.`
